abstract = "Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains."

abstract="To overcome the limitations of the conventional medical service in terms of ageing and chronic diseases, AmI-based precision medicine has drawn particular attention. Precision medicine is a customized personal medical service using various information technologies such as personal health device, AI algorithm, image recognition, voice recognition, and natural language processing. In particular, the information technologies for follow-up care services for patients, such as context awareness, context information, and inference rules, are required. In PHD, contexts such as variable data include blood pressure, BMI, blood sugar, weather, and food. It has time-series characteristics, meaning that it changes often with time. Other kinds of health-related information, such as age, family history, smoking, and residential area, are intermittently changed. For inference that is highly related to a user, the context collected through AmI is presented with ontology. Ontology consists of a user's ambient data, weather data, and lifelog. Context is changed along with a user's ambient conditions and time. An inference engine is used to create the knowledge base and predict a change. This study proposes a neural-network based adaptive context prediction model for ambient intelligence. This is a learning model using neural network to calculate the similarity for recommendation in a mining lifecare platform. In a conventional prediction procedure, an error is used to update a weight. The proposed model learns the similarity weight of the users to become adapted to the user's ambient. Based on the knowledge base, user clustering and deviation from mean are applied to calculate the similarity weight. Collaborative filtering technology is used to predict a user's context and learn the similarity weight repeatedly using a neural network. According to the performance evaluation, the proposed neural-network based similarity weight method had the highest accuracy of prediction when the learning rate was 0.001. Consequently, we found that AmI is a new added-value technology to maintain a healthy lifestyle and contributes to developing the healthcare industry and improving the quality of life.",

abstract="Context computing is a branch of ambient intelligence (AmI) research, which has been rapidly emerging in the support of intelligent smart health platform solution. To develop reliable ambient computing using the hybrid peer-to-peer network and Internet of Things, machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and context awareness have been applied. This study proposes an ambient context-based modeling for a health risk assessment using deep neural network. In the proposed method, we collected medical information from chronic disease patients such as EMR, PHR, and medical histories, as well as environmental data from a health platform. Subsequently, heterogeneous data are integrated through selecting, cleaning, modeling, and evaluating the collected raw data and then the context is created. The structured input data such as a sensor data are normalized by transforming the time domain data to the frequency domain information. Using a deep neural network, the normalized data are applied to create an ambient context. A deep neural network is composed of the following three layers: input layers with treated and untreated data; hidden layers where connection strength is trained as a weight; and output layers of trained results. In the deep neural network layers, the control of the weight of training data enables repeated learning to create an ambient context pattern. Using an ontology inference engine, unstructured/structured data, including individual health data and environmental information, and their context is presented as ontology metadata. In the knowledge base, hidden association relationships are discovered through mining. To inform the individual health conditions exposed to the individual environmental contexts, a health risk assessment model is developed with a set of the ambient context pattern learned with metadata and a deep neural network. The Minkowski distance formula, which defines a normalized geometrical distance between two nodes, is used to measure the similarity between the patients with chronical disease and the individual user based on the context. In the proposed model, the risk is represented as a similarity-based index. The risk assessment model can be implemented into the individual risk alert/prevention system. The model may significantly impact the healthcare industry as well as ambient intelligence research, thus contributing to improve the quality of human life of the future society.",

ABSTRACT = {The new Internet of Things/Everything (IoT/IoE) paradigm and architecture allows one to rethink the way Smart City infrastructures are designed and managed, but on the other hand, a number of problems have to be solved. In terms of mobility the cities that embrace the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of life of their citizens, also thanks to the rationalization in the use of their resources. In Sii-Mobility, a national smart city project on mobility and transportation, a flexible platform has been designed and here, in this paper, is presented. It permits one to set up heterogeneous and complex scenarios that integrate sensors/actuators as IoT/IoE in an overall Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Analytics scenario. A detailed and complex case-study has been presented to validate the solution in the context of a system that dynamically reverse the traveling direction of a road segment, with all the safety conditions in place. This case study composes several building blocks of the IoT platform, which demonstrate that a flexible and dynamic set-up is possible, supporting security, safety, local, cloud and mixed solutions.},

This editorial introduction to this special issue provides an overview and a conceptual framework of governance and economics of smart cities. We begin with a discussion of the background to smart cities and then it focuses on the key challenges for consideration in smart city economics. Here it is argued that there are four dimensions to smart city economics: the first is regarding the scale of global market for smart cities; the second issue concerns data to be used for smart city projects; the third concerns market competition and structure and the fourth concerns the impact on local economy. Likewise, smart city governance framework has to be considered a layered and multi-level concept focusing on issues of transparency and accountability to the citizens."

In this paper, we address the out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entity problem in KBC: how to answer queries concerning test entities not observed at training time. Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all test entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain embeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity problem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute the embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge provided at test time. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model in the OOKB setting. Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in which OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WordNet dataset.},

	title = {Efficiently Embedding Dynamic Knowledge Graphs},
	abstract = {Knowledge graph (KG) embedding encodes the entities and relations from a KG into low-dimensional vector spaces to support various applications such as KG completion, question answering, and recommender systems. In real world, knowledge graphs (KGs) are dynamic and evolve over time with addition or deletion of triples. However, most existing models focus on embedding static KGs while neglecting dynamics. To adapt to the changes in a KG, these models need to be re-trained on the whole KG with a high time cost. In this paper, to tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a new context-aware Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embedding (DKGE) method which supports the embedding learning in an online fashion. DKGE introduces two different representations (i.e., knowledge embedding and contextual element embedding) for each entity and each relation, in the joint modeling of entities and relations as well as their contexts, by employing two attentive graph convolutional networks, a gate strategy, and translation operations. This effectively helps limit the impacts of a KG update in certain regions, not in the entire graph, so that DKGE can rapidly acquire the updated KG embedding by a proposed online learning algorithm. Furthermore, DKGE can also learn KG embedding from scratch. Experiments on the tasks of link prediction and question answering in a dynamic environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DKGE.},

Our model combines a regular link prediction model learned from a knowledge graph with word embeddings learned from a textual corpus. After training both independently, we learn a transformation to map the embeddings of an entity's name and description to the graph-based embedding space. In experiments on several datasets including FB20k, DBPedia50k and our new dataset FB15k-237-OWE, we demonstrate competitive results. Particularly, our approach exploits the full knowledge graph structure even when textual descriptions are scarce, does not require a joint training on graph and text, and can be applied to any embedding-based link prediction model, such as TransE, ComplEx and DistMult.},

	abstract = {Constructing large-scale knowledge base has encountered a bottleneck because of the limitation of natural language processing. Many approaches have been put forward to infer new facts based on existing knowledge. Graph feature models mine rule-like patterns from a knowledge base and use them to predict missing edges. These models take account of the graph structure information and they can explain the existence of a fact reasonably. Existing models only describe local interaction between entities, but how to model co-relationships among facts globally is a tough problem. In this paper, we develop an efficient model which uses association rules to make inferences. First, we use a rule mining model to detect simple association rules and use them to produce large amounts of evidence. Second, based on all the produced evidence and the connections among them, we construct a factor graph which represents the inference space. Then, we develop an EM inference model, wherein the E-step we use Belief Propagation to calculate the marginal distribution of candidate edges and, in the M-step we propose a Generalized Iterative Proportional Fitting algorithm to re-learn the confidence of soft rules. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in knowledge base completion (KBC) tasks.},

The open world assumption corresponds to the usual first order approach to query evaluation: Given a data base DB and a query Q, the only answers to Q are those which obtain from proofs of Q given DB as hypotheses. Under the closed world assumption, certain answers are admitted as a result of failure to find a proof. More specifically, if no proof of a positive ground literal exists, then the negation of that literal is assumed true.",

abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

Several recent works suggest that convolutional neural network (CNN) based models generate richer and more expressive feature embeddings and hence also perform well on relation prediction. However, we observe that these KG embeddings treat triples independently and thus fail to cover the complex and hidden information that is inherently implicit in the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. To this effect, our paper proposes a novel attention-based feature embedding that captures both entity and relation features in any given entity{'}s neighborhood. Additionally, we also encapsulate relation clusters and multi-hop relations in our model. Our empirical study offers insights into the efficacy of our attention-based model and we show marked performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.",
