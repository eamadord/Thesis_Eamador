	abstract = {We propose Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks (KENN), an architecture for injecting prior knowledge, codified by a set of logical clauses, into a neural network.In KENN clauses are directly incorporated in the structure of the neural network as a new layer that includes a set of additional learnable parameters, called clause weights. As a consequence, KENN can learn the level of satisfiability to impose in the final classification. When training data contradicts a constraint, KENN learns to ignore it, making the system robust to the presence of wrong knowledge. Moreover, the method returns learned clause weights, which gives us informations about the influence of each constraint in the final predictions, increasing the interpretability of the model. We evaluated KENN on two standard datasets for multi-label classification, showing that the injection of clauses automatically extracted from the training data sensibly improves the performances. Furthermore, we apply KENN to solve the problem of finding relationship between detected objects in images by adopting manually curated clauses. The evaluation shows that KENN outperforms the state of the art methods on this task.},

Thus, the corresponding neurule base consists of a number of autonomous adaline units (neurules). In this paper, we present the construction process and the inference mechanism of neurules and explore their generalization capabilities. The construction process, which also implements corresponding learning algorithm, creates neurules from a given empirical data set. The inference mechanism of neurules is integrated in its nature; it combines neurocomputing with symbolic processes. It is also interactive, i.e., it interacts with the user asking him/her to provide values for some variables necessary to carry on inference. As shown via experiments, the neurules' integrated inference mechanism is more efficient than the inference mechanism used in connectionist expert systems. Furthermore, neurules generalize much better than their constituent neural component (adaline unit) and are comparable to the backpropagation neural net (BPNN).},

	abstract = {Deep Learning architectures can develop feature representations and classification models in an integrated way during training. This joint learning process requires large networks with many parameters, and it is successful when a large amount of training data is available. Instead of making the learner develop its entire understanding of the world from scratch from the input examples, the injection of prior knowledge into the learner seems to be a principled way to reduce the amount of require training data, as the learner does not need to induce the rules from the data. This paper presents a general framework to integrate arbitrary prior knowledge into learning. The domain knowledge is provided as a collection of first-order logic (FOL) clauses, where each task to be learned corresponds to a predicate in the knowledge base. The logic statements are translated into a set of differentiable constraints, which can be integrated into the learning process to distill the knowledge into the network, or used during inference to enforce the consistency of the predictions with the prior knowledge. The experimental results have been carried out on multiple image datasets and show that the integration of the prior knowledge boosts the accuracy of several state-of-the-art deep architectures on image classification tasks.},

	abstract = {Learning the underlying patterns in data goes beyond instance-based generalization to external knowledge represented in structured graphs or networks. Deep learning that primarily constitutes neural computing stream in AI has shown significant advances in probabilistically learning latent patterns using a multi-layered network of computational nodes (i.e., neurons/hidden units). Structured knowledge that underlies symbolic computing approaches and often supports reasoning, has also seen significant growth in recent years, in the form of broad-based (e.g., DBPedia, Yago) and domain, industry or application specific knowledge graphs. A common substrate with careful integration of the two will raise opportunities to develop neuro-symbolic learning approaches for AI, where conceptual and probabilistic representations are combined. As the incorporation of external knowledge will aid in supervising the learning of features for the model, deep infusion of representational knowledge from knowledge graphs within hidden layers will further enhance the learning process. Although much work remains, we believe that knowledge graphs will play an increasing role in developing hybrid neuro-symbolic intelligent systems (bottom-up deep learning with top-down symbolic computing) as well as in building explainable AI systems for which knowledge graphs will provide scaffolding for punctuating neural computing. In this position paper, we describe our motivation for such a neuro-symbolic approach and framework that combines knowledge graph and neural networks.},

We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute these explanations for any black-box model with high-probability guarantees. We demonstrate the flexibility of anchors by explaining a myriad of different models for different domains and tasks. In a user study, we show that anchors enable users to predict how a model would behave on unseen instances with less effort and higher precision, as compared to existing linear explanations or no explanations. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Ribeiro, Marco Tulio and Singh, Sameer and Guestrin, Carlos}, year={2018}, month={Apr.} }

abstract = "Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains."

abstract="To overcome the limitations of the conventional medical service in terms of ageing and chronic diseases, AmI-based precision medicine has drawn particular attention. Precision medicine is a customized personal medical service using various information technologies such as personal health device, AI algorithm, image recognition, voice recognition, and natural language processing. In particular, the information technologies for follow-up care services for patients, such as context awareness, context information, and inference rules, are required. In PHD, contexts such as variable data include blood pressure, BMI, blood sugar, weather, and food. It has time-series characteristics, meaning that it changes often with time. Other kinds of health-related information, such as age, family history, smoking, and residential area, are intermittently changed. For inference that is highly related to a user, the context collected through AmI is presented with ontology. Ontology consists of a user's ambient data, weather data, and lifelog. Context is changed along with a user's ambient conditions and time. An inference engine is used to create the knowledge base and predict a change. This study proposes a neural-network based adaptive context prediction model for ambient intelligence. This is a learning model using neural network to calculate the similarity for recommendation in a mining lifecare platform. In a conventional prediction procedure, an error is used to update a weight. The proposed model learns the similarity weight of the users to become adapted to the user's ambient. Based on the knowledge base, user clustering and deviation from mean are applied to calculate the similarity weight. Collaborative filtering technology is used to predict a user's context and learn the similarity weight repeatedly using a neural network. According to the performance evaluation, the proposed neural-network based similarity weight method had the highest accuracy of prediction when the learning rate was 0.001. Consequently, we found that AmI is a new added-value technology to maintain a healthy lifestyle and contributes to developing the healthcare industry and improving the quality of life.",

journal="Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing",

abstract="Context computing is a branch of ambient intelligence (AmI) research, which has been rapidly emerging in the support of intelligent smart health platform solution. To develop reliable ambient computing using the hybrid peer-to-peer network and Internet of Things, machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and context awareness have been applied. This study proposes an ambient context-based modeling for a health risk assessment using deep neural network. In the proposed method, we collected medical information from chronic disease patients such as EMR, PHR, and medical histories, as well as environmental data from a health platform. Subsequently, heterogeneous data are integrated through selecting, cleaning, modeling, and evaluating the collected raw data and then the context is created. The structured input data such as a sensor data are normalized by transforming the time domain data to the frequency domain information. Using a deep neural network, the normalized data are applied to create an ambient context. A deep neural network is composed of the following three layers: input layers with treated and untreated data; hidden layers where connection strength is trained as a weight; and output layers of trained results. In the deep neural network layers, the control of the weight of training data enables repeated learning to create an ambient context pattern. Using an ontology inference engine, unstructured/structured data, including individual health data and environmental information, and their context is presented as ontology metadata. In the knowledge base, hidden association relationships are discovered through mining. To inform the individual health conditions exposed to the individual environmental contexts, a health risk assessment model is developed with a set of the ambient context pattern learned with metadata and a deep neural network. The Minkowski distance formula, which defines a normalized geometrical distance between two nodes, is used to measure the similarity between the patients with chronical disease and the individual user based on the context. In the proposed model, the risk is represented as a similarity-based index. The risk assessment model can be implemented into the individual risk alert/prevention system. The model may significantly impact the healthcare industry as well as ambient intelligence research, thus contributing to improve the quality of human life of the future society.",

ABSTRACT = {The new Internet of Things/Everything (IoT/IoE) paradigm and architecture allows one to rethink the way Smart City infrastructures are designed and managed, but on the other hand, a number of problems have to be solved. In terms of mobility the cities that embrace the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of life of their citizens, also thanks to the rationalization in the use of their resources. In Sii-Mobility, a national smart city project on mobility and transportation, a flexible platform has been designed and here, in this paper, is presented. It permits one to set up heterogeneous and complex scenarios that integrate sensors/actuators as IoT/IoE in an overall Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Analytics scenario. A detailed and complex case-study has been presented to validate the solution in the context of a system that dynamically reverse the traveling direction of a road segment, with all the safety conditions in place. This case study composes several building blocks of the IoT platform, which demonstrate that a flexible and dynamic set-up is possible, supporting security, safety, local, cloud and mixed solutions.},

This editorial introduction to this special issue provides an overview and a conceptual framework of governance and economics of smart cities. We begin with a discussion of the background to smart cities and then it focuses on the key challenges for consideration in smart city economics. Here it is argued that there are four dimensions to smart city economics: the first is regarding the scale of global market for smart cities; the second issue concerns data to be used for smart city projects; the third concerns market competition and structure and the fourth concerns the impact on local economy. Likewise, smart city governance framework has to be considered a layered and multi-level concept focusing on issues of transparency and accountability to the citizens."

In this paper, we address the out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entity problem in KBC: how to answer queries concerning test entities not observed at training time. Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all test entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain embeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity problem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute the embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge provided at test time. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model in the OOKB setting. Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in which OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WordNet dataset.},

	title = {Efficiently Embedding Dynamic Knowledge Graphs},
	abstract = {Knowledge graph (KG) embedding encodes the entities and relations from a KG into low-dimensional vector spaces to support various applications such as KG completion, question answering, and recommender systems. In real world, knowledge graphs (KGs) are dynamic and evolve over time with addition or deletion of triples. However, most existing models focus on embedding static KGs while neglecting dynamics. To adapt to the changes in a KG, these models need to be re-trained on the whole KG with a high time cost. In this paper, to tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a new context-aware Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embedding (DKGE) method which supports the embedding learning in an online fashion. DKGE introduces two different representations (i.e., knowledge embedding and contextual element embedding) for each entity and each relation, in the joint modeling of entities and relations as well as their contexts, by employing two attentive graph convolutional networks, a gate strategy, and translation operations. This effectively helps limit the impacts of a KG update in certain regions, not in the entire graph, so that DKGE can rapidly acquire the updated KG embedding by a proposed online learning algorithm. Furthermore, DKGE can also learn KG embedding from scratch. Experiments on the tasks of link prediction and question answering in a dynamic environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DKGE.},

Our model combines a regular link prediction model learned from a knowledge graph with word embeddings learned from a textual corpus. After training both independently, we learn a transformation to map the embeddings of an entity's name and description to the graph-based embedding space. In experiments on several datasets including FB20k, DBPedia50k and our new dataset FB15k-237-OWE, we demonstrate competitive results. Particularly, our approach exploits the full knowledge graph structure even when textual descriptions are scarce, does not require a joint training on graph and text, and can be applied to any embedding-based link prediction model, such as TransE, ComplEx and DistMult.},

	abstract = {Constructing large-scale knowledge base has encountered a bottleneck because of the limitation of natural language processing. Many approaches have been put forward to infer new facts based on existing knowledge. Graph feature models mine rule-like patterns from a knowledge base and use them to predict missing edges. These models take account of the graph structure information and they can explain the existence of a fact reasonably. Existing models only describe local interaction between entities, but how to model co-relationships among facts globally is a tough problem. In this paper, we develop an efficient model which uses association rules to make inferences. First, we use a rule mining model to detect simple association rules and use them to produce large amounts of evidence. Second, based on all the produced evidence and the connections among them, we construct a factor graph which represents the inference space. Then, we develop an EM inference model, wherein the E-step we use Belief Propagation to calculate the marginal distribution of candidate edges and, in the M-step we propose a Generalized Iterative Proportional Fitting algorithm to re-learn the confidence of soft rules. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in knowledge base completion (KBC) tasks.},

Under the closed world assumption, certain answers are admitted as a result of failure to find a proof. More specifically, if no proof of a positive ground literal exists, then the negation of that literal is assumed true.",

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

Several recent works suggest that convolutional neural network (CNN) based models generate richer and more expressive feature embeddings and hence also perform well on relation prediction. However, we observe that these KG embeddings treat triples independently and thus fail to cover the complex and hidden information that is inherently implicit in the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. To this effect, our paper proposes a novel attention-based feature embedding that captures both entity and relation features in any given entity{'}s neighborhood. Additionally, we also encapsulate relation clusters and multi-hop relations in our model. Our empirical study offers insights into the efficacy of our attention-based model and we show marked performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.",

In this paper, we address the out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entity problem in KBC: how to answer queries concerning test entities not observed at training time. Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all test entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain embeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity problem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute the embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge provided at test time. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model in the OOKB setting. Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in which OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WordNet dataset.},

@article{dkge,
	title = {Efficiently Embedding Dynamic Knowledge Graphs},
	abstract = {Knowledge graph (KG) embedding encodes the entities and relations from a KG into low-dimensional vector spaces to support various applications such as KG completion, question answering, and recommender systems. In real world, knowledge graphs (KGs) are dynamic and evolve over time with addition or deletion of triples. However, most existing models focus on embedding static KGs while neglecting dynamics. To adapt to the changes in a KG, these models need to be re-trained on the whole KG with a high time cost. In this paper, to tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a new context-aware Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embedding (DKGE) method which supports the embedding learning in an online fashion. DKGE introduces two different representations (i.e., knowledge embedding and contextual element embedding) for each entity and each relation, in the joint modeling of entities and relations as well as their contexts, by employing two attentive graph convolutional networks, a gate strategy, and translation operations. This effectively helps limit the impacts of a KG update in certain regions, not in the entire graph, so that DKGE can rapidly acquire the updated KG embedding by a proposed online learning algorithm. Furthermore, DKGE can also learn KG embedding from scratch. Experiments on the tasks of link prediction and question answering in a dynamic environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DKGE.},

	abstract = {We present a novel extension to embedding-based knowledge graph completion models which enables them to perform open-world link prediction, i.e. to predict facts for entities unseen in training based on their textual description. Our model combines a regular link prediction model learned from a knowledge graph with word embeddings learned from a textual corpus. After training both independently, we learn a transformation to map the embeddings of an entity's name and description to the graph-based embedding space. In experiments on several datasets including FB20k, DBPedia50k and our new dataset FB15k-237-OWE, we demonstrate competitive results. Particularly, our approach exploits the full knowledge graph structure even when textual descriptions are scarce, does not require a joint training on graph and text, and can be applied to any embedding-based link prediction model, such as TransE, ComplEx and DistMult.},

	abstract = {Constructing large-scale knowledge base has encountered a bottleneck because of the limitation of natural language processing. Many approaches have been put forward to infer new facts based on existing knowledge. Graph feature models mine rule-like patterns from a knowledge base and use them to predict missing edges. These models take account of the graph structure information and they can explain the existence of a fact reasonably. Existing models only describe local interaction between entities, but how to model co-relationships among facts globally is a tough problem. In this paper, we develop an efficient model which uses association rules to make inferences. First, we use a rule mining model to detect simple association rules and use them to produce large amounts of evidence. Second, based on all the produced evidence and the connections among them, we construct a factor graph which represents the inference space. Then, we develop an EM inference model, wherein the E-step we use Belief Propagation to calculate the marginal distribution of candidate edges and, in the M-step we propose a Generalized Iterative Proportional Fitting algorithm to re-learn the confidence of soft rules. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in knowledge base completion (KBC) tasks.},

The open world assumption corresponds to the usual first order approach to query evaluation: Given a data base DB and a query Q, the only answers to Q are those which obtain from proofs of Q given DB as hypotheses. Under the closed world assumption, certain answers are admitted as a result of failure to find a proof. More specifically, if no proof of a positive ground literal exists, then the negation of that literal is assumed true.",

abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

Several recent works suggest that convolutional neural network (CNN) based models generate richer and more expressive feature embeddings and hence also perform well on relation prediction. However, we observe that these KG embeddings treat triples independently and thus fail to cover the complex and hidden information that is inherently implicit in the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. To this effect, our paper proposes a novel attention-based feature embedding that captures both entity and relation features in any given entity{'}s neighborhood. Additionally, we also encapsulate relation clusters and multi-hop relations in our model. Our empirical study offers insights into the efficacy of our attention-based model and we show marked performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.",

	abstract = {Nowadays, in the international scientific community of machine learning, there exists an enormous discussion about the use of black-box models or explainable models; especially in practical problems. On the one hand, a part of the community defends that black-box models are more accurate than explainable models in some contexts, like image preprocessing. On the other hand, there exist another part of the community alleging that explainable models are better than black-box models because they can obtain comparable results and also they can explain these results in a language close to a human expert by using patterns. In this paper, advantages and weaknesses for each approach are shown; taking into account a state-of-the-art review for both approaches, their practical applications, trends, and future challenges. This paper shows that both approaches are suitable for solving practical problems, but experts in machine learning need to understand the input data, the problem to solve, and the best way for showing the output data before applying a machine learning model. Also, we propose some ideas for fusing both, explainable and black-box, approaches to provide better solutions to experts in real-world domains. Additionally, we show one way to measure the effectiveness of the applied machine learning model by using expert opinions jointly with statistical methods. Throughout this paper, we show the impact of using explainable and black-box models on the security and medical applications.},

Traditionally, logic-based symbolic methods from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning have been used to equip agents with capabilities that resemble human logical reasoning qualities. More recently, however, there has been an increasing interest in using machine learning rather than logic-based symbolic formalisms to tackle these tasks. In this paper, we employ state-of-the-art methods for training deep neural networks to devise a novel model that is able to learn how to effectively perform logical reasoning in the form of basic ontology reasoning. This is an important and at the same time very natural logical reasoning task, which is why the presented approach is applicable to a plethora of important real-world problems. We present the outcomes of several experiments, which show that our model is able to learn to perform highly accurate ontology reasoning on very large, diverse, and challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, it turned out that the suggested approach suffers much less from different obstacles that prohibit logic-based symbolic reasoning, and, at the same time, is surprisingly plausible from a biological point of view. © 2020 AI Access Foundation.

	abstract = {AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and “collaborate” with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI “partners” with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying ‘psychological’ mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously. For this purpose a first framework for educational content is proposed. © Copyright © 2021 Korteling, van de Boer-Visschedijk, Blankendaal, Boonekamp and Eikelboom.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as medical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, decision support systems, among many others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep learning models. There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that make deep learning models more transparent and explainable to humans. Some researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve human-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We performed a Latent Dirichlet topic modelling analysis (LDA) under a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis yielded a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications to real-world data. Our research suggests that current model-agnostic counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human decision-maker. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the explanations derived from popular algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous, or even biased explanations. Thus, this paper also advances the literature with new directions and challenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for explainable AI.},

	abstract = {Current machine learning systems operate, almost exclusively, in a statistical, or model-free mode, which entails severe theoretical limits on their power and performance. Such systems cannot reason about interventions and retrospection and, therefore, cannot serve as the basis for strong AI. To achieve human level intelligence, learning machines need the guidance of a model of reality, similar to the ones used in causal inference tasks. To demonstrate the essential role of such models, I will present a summary of seven tasks which are beyond reach of current machine learning systems and which have been accomplished using the tools of causal modeling.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models contributed to reaching unprecedented results in prediction and classification tasks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, alongside this notable progress, they do not provide human-understandable insights on how a specific result was achieved. In contexts where the impact of AI on human life is relevant (e.g., recruitment tools, medical diagnoses, etc.), explainability is not only a desirable property, but it is-or, in some cases, it will be soon-a legal requirement. Most of the available approaches to implement eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on technical solutions usable only by experts able to manipulate the recursive mathematical functions in deep learning algorithms. A complementary approach is represented by symbolic AI, where symbols are elements of a lingua franca between humans and deep learning. In this context, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their underlying semantic technologies are the modern implementation of symbolic AI-while being less flexible and robust to noise compared to deep learning models, KGs are natively developed to be explainable. In this paper, we review the main XAI approaches existing in the literature, underlying their strengths and limitations, and we propose neural-symbolic integration as a cornerstone to design an AI which is closer to non-insiders comprehension. Within such a general direction, we identify three specific challenges for future research-knowledge matching, cross-disciplinary explanations and interactive explanations. © 2020 by the author.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

The available ontologies and knowledge graphs that encode such conceptual knowledge, however, are inevitably incomplete. This observation has led to a number of methods that aim to automatically complete existing knowledge bases. Unfortunately, most existing approaches rely on black box models, e.g. formulated as global optimization problems, which makes it difficult to support the underlying reasoning process with intuitive explanations. In this paper, we propose a new method for knowledge base completion, which uses interpretable conceptual space representations and an explicit model for inductive inference that is closer to human forms of commonsense reasoning. Moreover, by separating the task of representation learning from inductive reasoning, our method is easier to apply in a wider variety of contexts. Finally, unlike optimization based approaches, our method can naturally be applied in settings where various logical constraints between the extensions of concepts need to be taken into account. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Bouraoui, Zied and Jameel, Shoaib and Schockaert, Steven}, year={2017}, month={Feb.} }

This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},

This paper describes the process of ontology learning and further classification of ontology learning techniques into three classes (linguistics, statistical and logical) and discusses many algorithms under each category.

For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

Recent years have seen a large number of publications on such hybrid neuro-symbolic AI systems. That rapidly growing literature is highly diverse, mostly empirical, and is lacking a unifying view of the large variety of these hybrid systems. In this paper, we analyze a large body of recent literature and we propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building blocks. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems organized in a set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI systems. Our patterns reveal similarities between systems that were not recognized until now. Finally, our design patterns extend and refine Kautz’s earlier attempt at categorizing neuro-symbolic architectures. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as medical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, decision support systems, among many others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep learning models. There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that make deep learning models more transparent and explainable to humans. Some researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve human-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We performed a Latent Dirichlet topic modelling analysis (LDA) under a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis yielded a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications to real-world data. Our research suggests that current model-agnostic counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human decision-maker. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the explanations derived from popular algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous, or even biased explanations. Thus, this paper also advances the literature with new directions and challenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for explainable AI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

However, it is now generally accepted that deep learning alone has not been able to satisfy the requirement of fairness and, ultimately, trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we propose an interactive neural-symbolic approach for fairness in AI based on the Logic Tensor Network (LTN) framework. We show that the extraction of symbolic knowledge from LTN-based deep networks combined with fairness constraints offer a general method for instilling fairness into deep networks via continual learning. Explainable AI approaches which otherwise could identify but not fix fairness issues are shown to be enriched with an ability to improve fairness results. Experimental results on three real-world data sets used to predict income, credit risk and recidivism in financial applications show that our approach can satisfy fairness metrics while maintaining state-of-the-art classification performance. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The rivalry was due essentially to ignorance on the implications of the knowledge level, as introduced by Newell and Marr. Now it is generally accepted that they are different and complementary forms of modeling and operationalizing the inferences in terms of which a problem solving method (PSM) decomposes a task. All these tasks, methods, inferences, and formal operators belong to a broad library of reusable components for knowledge modeling. The final configuration of a problem solving method, with symbolic and connectionist components, is only dependent on the particular balance between data and knowledge available for the specific application under consideration. Various approaches have been explored for neurosymbolic integration. In this paper we propose a classification of these approaches (unified, hybrid and system level) and strongly support that the integration has to be made at the knowledge level and in the domain of the external observer (the "house" of models). © Springer-Verlag 2003.},

In such a situation it has been found that a case-based reasoning system, in combination with an artifical neural network, can provide a more effective means of performing such predictions than other connectionist or symbolic techniques. The case-based reasoning system incorporates a radial basis function artificial neural network for the case adaptation.

Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities: the ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what has been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation. In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as a principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the construction of explainable AI systems. The insights provided by neural-symbolic computing shed new light on the increasingly prominent need for interpretable and accountable AI systems.},

Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this context.},

This paper presents Relational Reasoning Networks (R2N), a novel end-to-end model that performs relational reasoning in the latent space of a deep learner architecture, where the representations of constants, ground atoms and their manipulations are learned in an integrated fashion. Unlike ﬂat architectures like Knowledge Graph Embedders, which can only represent relations between entities, R2Ns deﬁne an additional computational structure, accounting for higher-level relations among the ground atoms. The considered relations can be explicitly known, like the ones deﬁned by logic formulas, or deﬁned as unconstrained correlations among groups of ground atoms. R2Ns can be applied to purely symbolic tasks or as a neuro-symbolic platform to integrate learning and reasoning in heterogeneous problems with both symbolic and feature-based represented entities. The proposed model bridges the gap between previous neuro-symbolic methods that have been either limited in terms of scalability or expressivity.

ABSTRACT = {Together with the disruptive development of modern sub-symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence (AI), symbolic approaches to classical AI are re-gaining momentum, as more and more researchers exploit their potential to make AI more comprehensible, explainable, and therefore trustworthy. Since logic-based approaches lay at the core of symbolic AI, summarizing their state of the art is of paramount importance now more than ever, in order to identify trends, benefits, key features, gaps, and limitations of the techniques proposed so far, as well as to identify promising research perspectives. Along this line, this paper provides an overview of logic-based approaches and technologies by sketching their evolution and pointing out their main application areas. Future perspectives for exploitation of logic-based technologies are discussed as well, in order to identify those research fields that deserve more attention, considering the areas that already exploit logic-based approaches as well as those that are more likely to adopt logic-based approaches in the future.},

abstract={The tools of artificial intelligence (AI) can be divided into two broad types: knowledge-based systems (KBSs) and computational intelligence (CI). KBSs use explicit representations of knowledge in the form of words and symbols. This explicit representation makes the knowledge more easily read and understood by a human than the numerically derived implicit models in computational intelligence. KBSs include techniques such as rule-based, modelbased, and case-based reasoning. They were among the first forms of investigation into AI and remain a major theme. Early research focused on specialist applications in areas such as chemistry, medicine, and computer hardware. These early successes generated great optimism in AI, but more broad-based representations of human intelligence have remained difficult to achieve (Hopgood, 2003; Hopgood, 2005).},

abstract={A new research area, Inductive Logic Programming, is presently emerging. While inheriting various positive characteristics of the parent subjects of Logic Programming and Machine Learning, it is hoped that the new area will overcome many of the limitations of its forebears. The background to present developments within this area is discussed and various goals and aspirations for the increasing body of researchers are identified. Inductive Logic Programming needs to be based on sound principles from both Logic and Statistics. On the side of statistical justification of hypotheses we discuss the possible relationship between Algorithmic Complexity theory and Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) Learning. In terms of logic we provide a unifying framework for Muggleton and Buntine's Inverse Resolution (IR) and Plotkin's Relative Least General Generalisation (RLGG) by rederiving RLGG in terms of IR. This leads to a discussion of the feasibility of extending the RLGG framework to allow for the invention of new predicates, previously discussed only within the context of IR.},

simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among
features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with
state-of-the-art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of
whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even
better. In this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from
data, based on the theory of learning Bayesian networks. These networks are factored representations of
probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and
explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches
we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time
maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness
that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches,
using problems from the University of California at Irvine repository, and 
compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper methods for feature
selection.},

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.",

However, with the explosion of network volume, the problem of data sparsity that causes large-scale KG systems to calculate and manage difficultly has become more significant. For alleviating the issue, knowledge graph embedding is proposed to embed entities and relations in a KG to a low-, dense and continuous feature space, and endow the yield model with abilities of knowledge inference and fusion. In recent years, many researchers have poured much attention in this approach, and we will systematically introduce the existing state-of-the-art approaches and a variety of applications that benefit from these methods in this paper. In addition, we discuss future prospects for the development of techniques and application trends. Specifically, we first introduce the embedding models that only leverage the information of observed triplets in the KG. We illustrate the overall framework and specific idea and compare the advantages and disadvantages of such approaches. Next, we introduce the advanced models that utilize additional semantic information to improve the performance of the original methods. We divide the additional information into two categories, including textual descriptions and relation paths. The extension approaches in each category are described, following the same classification criteria as those defined for the triplet fact-based models. We then describe two experiments for comparing the performance of listed methods and mention some broader domain tasks such as question answering, recommender systems, and so forth. Finally, we collect several hurdles that need to be overcome and provide a few future research directions for knowledge graph embedding.},

Recent years have seen a large number of publications on such hybrid neuro-symbolic AI systems. That rapidly growing literature is highly diverse, mostly empirical, and is lacking a unifying view of the large variety of these hybrid systems. In this paper, we analyze a large body of recent literature and we propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building blocks. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems organized in a set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI systems. Our patterns reveal similarities between systems that were not recognized until now.

However, concerns about interpretability and accountability of AI have been raised by influential thinkers. In spite of the recent impact of AI, several works have identified the need for principled knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms integrated with deep learning-based systems to provide sound and explainable models for such systems. Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities: the ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what has been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation. In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as a principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the construction of explainable AI systems. The insights provided by neural-symbolic computing shed new light on the increasingly prominent need for interpretable and accountable AI systems.},

Neural networks have unique processing characteristics that enable tasks to be performed that would be di cult or intractable for a symbolic rule-based system. However, a stand-alone neural network requires an interpretation either by a human or a rulebased system. This motivates the integration of neural/symbolic techniques within a hybrid system. A number of integration possibilities exist: some systems consist of neural network components performing symbolic tasks while other systems are composed of several neural networks and symbolic components, each component acting as a self-contained module communicating with the others. Other hybrid systems are able to transform subsymbolic representations into symbolic ones and vice-versa.

	abstract = {Current advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have achieved unprecedented impact across research communities and industry. Nevertheless, concerns about trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI were raised by influential thinkers. Many have identified the need for well-founded knowledge representation and reasoning to be integrated with deep learning and for sound explainability. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability via symbolic representations for network models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research results in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the key ingredients of the next wave of AI systems. We focus on research that integrates in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning. The insights provided by 20 years of neural-symbolic computing are shown to shed new light onto the increasingly prominent role of trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI. We also identify promising directions and challenges for the next decade of AI research from the perspective of neural-symbolic systems.},

This “Challenges and Promises” paper argues for a complementary endeavor: pursuing ways that the case-based reasoning methodology can advance deep learning.

	abstract = {We propose Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks (KENN), an architecture for injecting prior knowledge, codified by a set of logical clauses, into a neural network.In KENN clauses are directly incorporated in the structure of the neural network as a new layer that includes a set of additional learnable parameters, called clause weights. As a consequence, KENN can learn the level of satisfiability to impose in the final classification. When training data contradicts a constraint, KENN learns to ignore it, making the system robust to the presence of wrong knowledge. Moreover, the method returns learned clause weights, which gives us informations about the influence of each constraint in the final predictions, increasing the interpretability of the model. We evaluated KENN on two standard datasets for multi-label classification, showing that the injection of clauses automatically extracted from the training data sensibly improves the performances. Furthermore, we apply KENN to solve the problem of finding relationship between detected objects in images by adopting manually curated clauses. The evaluation shows that KENN outperforms the state of the art methods on this task.},

	abstract = {Symbolic Systems in Artiﬁcial Intelligence which are based on formal logic and deductive reasoning are fundamentally diﬀerent from Artiﬁcial Intelligence systems based on artiﬁcial neural networks, such as deep learning approaches. The diﬀerence is not only in their inner workings and general approach, but also with respect to capabilities. Neural-symbolic Integration, as a ﬁeld of study, aims to bridge between the two paradigms. In this paper, we will discuss neural-symbolic integration in its relation to the Semantic Web ﬁeld, with a focus on promises and possible beneﬁts for both, and report on some current research on the topic.},

	abstract = {The study and understanding of human behaviour is relevant to computer science, artificial intelligence, neural computation, cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and several other areas. Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.},
